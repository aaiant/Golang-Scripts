<h2>Golang-Scripts</h2>
- About this Repo: This is a repository where I aim to upload as many scripts as possible and, potentially, future APIs or applications, either GUI-based with Fyne or based on Gin. I have started to familiarize myself as much as possible with Golang. As a result, I will upload all my accomplishments here as I progress in my knowledge and experimentation with this language.
<br>&emsp;Thank you for taking the time to review this GitHub repository. 
<br>I appreciate your interest in my work. ðŸ™‚
